Dawn Chorus is a school project developed by [[the team|a team]] at [BG/BRG Villach, St. Martin](https://www.it-gymnasium.at). The aim of the project is to conduct a year-long study of ecoacoustics at various sites in and around Villach.

The project encompasses:

## #recording toolkit and process.
- [[Dawn Chorus ARU]] - #active-development the development of our very own solar-powered recording unit based on a Raspberry Pi Zero 
- [[Autonomous Recording Units|Autonomous Recording Units]] - some background on currently available tools for long-term audio in remote places

## #analysis of the recorded sounds
... with a view towards biodiversity monitoring, studying the change in soundscapes over the course of a year and assessing human impact on soundscapes
- [[Programming Spectrograms in Julia]] - which explains how the project logo can be created by analysing sound
- [[Spectrogram]] - What does a bird's eye view of a sound recording look like and how do we get there?

## #exhibition  development
... showcasing the data collected in the course of the project and discussing their societal relevance
- [[Sound Showers]] - #active-development  - the development of speakers with parabolic sound reflectors to showcase our recordings

## #teaching based on a project
- [[Physics lab on developing specifications]] - Our very first experimental lab course focused at developing specifications for the [[Dawn Chorus ARU]] and the [[Sound Showers]]

## Building a knowledge base of #background information 
and educational material about [[Ecoacoustics]]
- [[Digital Audio and the wav-Format]] - What is digital audio? What are important parameters when talking about digital audio? How is digital audio stored?
- [[Fast Fourier Transforms]] - #work-in-progress
- [[Microphones]] - #work-in-progress 
- [[Raspberry Pi]] - #work-in-progress 
- [[Solar Power and Batteries]] - #work-in-progress
